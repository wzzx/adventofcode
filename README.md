# adventofcode

Repository where I will be pushing the go(just started learning) solutions for
the https://adventofcode.com/2018/ challenges (while I am motivated).

For the time being I'm focusing mostly on understanding the language, learning
the syntax and libraries and not so much on the quality of code(redundant steps,
bad choice of data structures, different ways of breaking the code into
functions, etc). So sorry if you are checking this code and your eyes start
bleeding, I'm seeking familiarity and functionality here not, craft and
performance.
